BBSCoin.xyz which is the main website of BBS Coin was created in PHP, files have been moved to the folder "php". 
There is a modification in the core.inc.php file on the way it handles languages by hostname.

A new copy/version of the website has been generated in Perl, thus is in the "perl" folder. An additional file for cookie handling(cookie.lib) has been added to the list.

The language folder contains the language files and has to be moved into the folder of the version of the website you intend to use (PHP or Perl). All language files are now in JSON format.
